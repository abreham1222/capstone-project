# Getting Started

**This project is the presentation of a fictional event website for mobile and desktop. It was built based on the [original design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015) idea by Cindy Shin in Behance applying the acquired knowledge about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through this module.**
